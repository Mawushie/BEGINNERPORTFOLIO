                    <p>I'm Matilda Afi Mawushie Honyah. I know it's a long name, but you can call
                        me by whichever you're comfortable with.:-)
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm a web designer(or shoud I say aspiring, lol)</p>
                    <p>I just started learning web development and this is a little project to 
                        demonstrate the html and css I have learned so far.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">A little about me.</h3>
                <p>I graduated from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)
                    in 2017.
                <p>I have been working at the National Service Regional Office in Accra
                    since then as part of the team that introduced the National Service
                    Certificate Delivery System (i.e Clearing Hub).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working hand in hand with Clearing Hub and National Service piqued my 
                    interest in Web Development and now I am enrolled at <a href="https://codetraingh.com/">
                    Codetrain,</a> learning
                    to become a full stack web and software developer.
                    Looking forward  to a great journey.
                </p>
